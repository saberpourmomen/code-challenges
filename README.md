Welcome to my Code Challenges repository! Here, I have collected a variety of coding challenges and common problems that I've solved using Java and Spring Boot. 
This repository is intended to serve as a resource for common patterns and complex solutions that showcase effective techniques and best practices in Java and Spring Boot development.

Feel free to explore, learn, and use these examples to enhance your coding skills or get ideas for tackling similar problems.

Happy coding!
